# PatternGame

This project contains a simple program that operates as a pseudo "Simon" style game. After displayling a light, the user must click the corresponding button to score a point. If the user presses incorrectly, the game resets.

 This game was written for the TI MSP430FR6989 microcontroller in assembly with TI Code Composer Studio 12.

## Usage
 
 To use this program, download the latest release zip file. Open CCStudio 12 and import the PatternGame.zip file to your workspace. You can then flash or debug the main.asm file.
 
-----------------------
**Note:** When viewing .asm files in this repo, I suggest switching tab indent size to 4. This is the eclipse default and will make the code aligned and readable.
